The goal of this project will be to implement [Zero-Knowledge Sets](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Zero%20Knowledge/Zero-Knowledge_Sets.pdf). This enables proving membership AND non-membership of an item to a pre-comitted set without revealing other members or the cardanality of the set.
